- https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_all_together
- https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec ("basic" section)


## Getting started

Install library in project:
```sh
yarn add @file-services/resolve
```

Then, use the programmatic API:
```ts
import { createRequestResolver } from '@file-services/resolve'
import { createMemoryFs } from '@file-services/memory'

const fs = createMemoryFs({
    'some-folder': {
        'index.js': 'some content'
    }
})

const resolveRequest = createRequestResolver({ fs })

resolveRequest('/', './some-folder')
// === '/some-folder/index.js'
```
